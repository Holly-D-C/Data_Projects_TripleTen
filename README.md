# TripleTen_Projects

Projects completed as part of the **TripleTen Data Science Bootcamp**, covering data analysis, SQL, statistics, and machine learning.  
Each project was completed independently and reflects end-to-end problem solving: data cleaning, analysis, modeling, and business recommendations.

| # | Project | Description |
| :--: | ------- | ----------- |
| 1 | [IMDb Movie Trends Analysis](https://holly-d-c.github.io/my-portfolio/projects.html) | Cleaned and analyzed IMDb data to uncover rating trends, top films by decade, and actor participation using Python and EDA techniques. |
| 2 | [Instacart Customer Behavior Analysis](https://holly-d-c.github.io/my-portfolio/projects.html) | Analyzed 480K+ grocery orders to identify peak shopping times, reorder behavior, and product demand patterns. |
| 3 | [Mobile Plan Revenue Analysis](https://holly-d-c.github.io/my-portfolio/projects.html) | Evaluated pricing strategies and customer usage to identify revenue drivers and statistically significant differences between plans. |
| 4 | [Video Game Sales Analysis](https://holly-d-c.github.io/my-portfolio/projects.html) | Analyzed global video game sales data and built predictive models to identify drivers of commercial success. |
| 5 | [Startup & Investment SQL Analysis](https://holly-d-c.github.io/my-portfolio/projects.html) | Used advanced SQL to analyze startup funding, acquisitions, geographic trends, and investor activity. |
| 6 | [Mobile Plan Recommendation Model](https://holly-d-c.github.io/my-portfolio/projects.html) | Built and evaluated machine learning models to recommend optimal mobile plans, achieving 79.8% accuracy. |
| 7 | [Retention Analytics with Machine Learning](https://holly-d-c.github.io/my-portfolio/projects.html) | Developed churn prediction models using supervised learning, achieving F1 = 0.601 and AUC-ROC = 0.844. |
| 8 | [Oil Well Profitability & Risk Analysis](https://holly-d-c.github.io/my-portfolio/projects.html) | Forecasted oil reserves, simulated profits, and assessed financial risk using regression and bootstrapping. |
| 9 | [Gold Recovery Prediction with Machine Learning](https://holly-d-c.github.io/my-portfolio/projects.html) | Built a machine learning model to predict gold recovery rates from industrial sensor data, optimizing production efficiency and reducing process risk. |
| 10 | [Insurance Benefit Prediction & Data Obfuscation](https://holly-d-c.github.io/my-portfolio/projects.html) | Applied classification and regression models to predict insurance benefit usage while preserving customer privacy through data obfuscation. |
| 11 | [Used Car Price Prediction with Gradient Boosting](https://holly-d-c.github.io/my-portfolio/projects.html) | Compared gradient boosting models to predict used car prices, optimizing accuracy, training time, and inference speed. |
| 12 | [Hourly Taxi Demand Forecasting](https://holly-d-c.github.io/my-portfolio/projects.html) | Developed time series and machine learning models to forecast hourly taxi demand, improving operational planning and driver allocation. |
